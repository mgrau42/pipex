<div><h1 align="center"> Pipex <h1></div> 

 This repository contains the source code for Pipex, a C program that imitates the behavior of the shell command < infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how the shell behaves when it needs to redirect the STDIN and the STDOUT, and to show how this behavior can be reproduced using the C programming language. The program is written in C and includes examples of how to use the "<", "<<", ">", and ">>" operators.

## Technologies Used

- C

- STDIN

- STDOUT

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the command line and navigate to the cloned repository.
3. Add you OpenAI API key to AICaller.py.
4. Run the `readme_generator.py` script.
5. The README file will be generated in the same directory as the script.
6. Still a work in progress, but rn you can grasp the general idea.
7. Check you readme througly, This OpenAi model is NOT finetunned, tends to hallucinate.
